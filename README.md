# RL Algorithms

A collection of implementations of RL algorithms in Python. Developed for my own personal learning as I work through papers and turtorials.

### Algorithms implemented
1. Simple Policy gradient:
  - using only a policy network and no advantage function
  - also imlemented using reward-to-go


### Resources used
